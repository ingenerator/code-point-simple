# CodePoint Simple

We started this library for a project that ultimately did not require it, and before there were
many good options for accessing the UK open data postcode set. It never got completed, and there
are now a number of better ways to solve the problem.

We recommend looking at http://postcodes.io/ for a simple and free hosted API, or their
open-source version for self hosting at https://github.com/ideal-postcodes/postcodes.io

Thanks for your interest!
